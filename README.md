# Flutter Mobile App Template Project

This is a custom Flutter mobile app template project that I created for my personal use. The purpose of this project is to serve as the starting point for any future mobile app project that I undertake. By using this template as a foundation, I can save time and effort in setting up the basic structure and functionality of my apps, and focus on implementing the unique features and design that make each app unique.

## Features

This template includes the following basic features:

- A simple UI with Splash, Login, Home and subScreen Views
- Navigation using Fluro
- A basic use of cache with SharedPreferences
- An http client using Dio and a ready to use config file
- The basic project architecture

## Getting Started

To use this template for your own app projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Remove the current remote repository : 

`git remote remove origin`

3. Add the new remote repository : 

`git remote add origin [new_remote_repository_url]`

4. Verify that the new remote repository was added successfully :

`git remote -v`

5. Push the code to the new remote repository:

`git push -u origin main`
